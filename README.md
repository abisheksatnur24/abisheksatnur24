- 👋 Hi, I’m @abisheksatnur24
- 👀 I’m interested in all things code. I am a sophomore doing CS at Virginia Tech trying to improve my coding skills!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning UNIX, C, Python, Java, Javascript, Angular
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project to which I can make any contribution to and better my coding skills. I have most experience building object oriented programming related applications in java and python. I have also built fullstack applications via use of HTML/CSS & Python scripts along with MySQL/SQLite databases. I am learning Javascript and Angular as well.
